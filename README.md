# BEAR_JumpyBois
A simple 2D game made in Unity. User input is either through the keyboard or EMG signals. The objective of this game is to allow players who have upper limb deficiencies practice hand grasps so they may better control an upper-limb prosthetic device. Metrics related to performance will be collected in the background.
